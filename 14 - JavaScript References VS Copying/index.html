    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

   


    // and we want to make a copy of it.
     const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lexa';
    console.log(team, players);
 
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    //it will take every item of the iterable and put it in the array
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const capitain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    //we made a reference to the original one
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99}); //last part - properties i want to override
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //Object Spread
    const captain2 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'

      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    //now if you change twitter it will change it both in wes and in dev! because it is second level deep
    //so instead- copy
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
